Stephanie mom mom Stephanie
The field blooms, and it turns gray
Sing me a lullaby mom
I still want to hear your native word

She rocked me, gave me a rhythm and probably did not take away the strength of will from me, because she gave
She probably knew more than Solomon
I will always come to you by broken roads
She will not wake me, she will not wake me, in strong storms
He will take two muzzles from his grandmother, as if they were bullets
She knew me very well, she was not deceived, she was very tired, she rocked me in time
Luli Luli Luli ...
